# COVID-Prediction-using-LSTM
The COVID-19 pandemic is the first time in history that we have experienced a problem of this size, and at the same time, we can process and understand the large amount of data gathered. We have various organizations (government, newspapers, academic institutions, etc.) collecting and publishing COVID-19 related data continuously. We need a robust and quick method to process substantial amounts of data and display meaningful and actionable valuable output for the public's health.
Using the Google Open dataset [1], we process infectious and morbidity rates based on population size to analyze the results of 3 different time series models. Counties in the US are identified as rural, suburban, and urban for comparison purposes. We have used three deep learning models â€“ Stacked LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM, and Multivariate CNN to perform comparative analysis. Using Big Data techniques with distributed models is the straightforward way to process the massive amounts of data. Utilizing a cluster with more than one worker will enable the daily processing of the incoming data quickly. The goal is to stay ahead of the spread of infectious disease in a community. This is a colaborative work with Karen Rivera, Anju Gopinath and Poornima Gunhalkar as part of CS535-Big Data course.
